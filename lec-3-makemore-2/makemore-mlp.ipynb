    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Dataset and Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create the Dataset**:\n",
    "    * Load the `names.txt` file and define your character vocabulary (`stoi`, `itos`).\n",
    "    * Choose a `block_size` (context length), which is the number of previous characters used to predict the next one.\n",
    "    * Iterate through each word and create a list of contexts (`X`) and their corresponding next characters (`Y`). The `.` token is used to pad the context at the beginning and signal the end of a word.\n",
    "    * Shuffle the words and split the dataset into **training (80%)**, **validation (10%)**, and **test (10%)** sets. Use `Xtr, Ytr`, `Xdev, Ydev`, and `Xte, Yte` to store these.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize the Neural Network**:\n",
    "    * **Embedding Layer**: Create an embedding lookup table `C` as a `27x10` tensor. Each row represents a character, and the 10 values are its **embedding**. This is a trainable parameter.\n",
    "    * **Hidden Layer**: Define the weights `W1` (a `30x200` tensor, `30` because `block_size * embedding_size = 3 * 10`) and biases `b1` (`200` elements).\n",
    "    * **Output Layer**: Define the weights `W2` (`200x27`) and biases `b2` (`27` elements). The output size matches the number of characters.\n",
    "    * Put all these tensors (`C, W1, b1, W2, b2`) into a list called `parameters` and set `requires_grad=True` for all of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Set Up the Training Loop**:\n",
    "    * Loop for a specified number of iterations (e.g., 200,000).\n",
    "    * For each iteration, construct a **minibatch** by randomly selecting a small number of indices (`ix`) from your training data `Xtr` and `Ytr`.\n",
    "2.  **Forward Pass**:\n",
    "    * Perform an **embedding lookup**: Use `Xtr[ix]` to get the embeddings from `C`, resulting in a tensor of shape `(batch_size, block_size, embedding_size)`.\n",
    "    * Reshape the embeddings into a single vector per example using `.view(-1, block_size * embedding_size)`.\n",
    "    * Pass this through the hidden layer: compute `emb.view(...) @ W1 + b1` and apply the **tanh activation function**.\n",
    "    * Pass the hidden layer output through the output layer: compute `h @ W2 + b2`. This gives you the `logits`.\n",
    "    * Calculate the **loss** using PyTorch's `F.cross_entropy`, passing in the `logits` and the labels `Ytr[ix]`. This function efficiently combines `softmax`, `log`, and `mean`.\n",
    "3.  **Backward Pass and Update**:\n",
    "    * Zero out the gradients for all parameters by setting `p.grad = None` for each parameter `p`.\n",
    "    * Call `loss.backward()` to compute the gradients.\n",
    "    * Update the parameters using a learning rate: `p.data += -lr * p.grad`. Use a decaying learning rate, such as starting with `0.1` and dropping to `0.01` after a certain number of steps.\n",
    "4.  **Evaluate and Visualize**:\n",
    "    * After training, evaluate the loss on the validation set (`Xdev, Ydev`) to check for **overfitting**.\n",
    "    * Visualize the embedding space by plotting the first two dimensions of the `C` matrix. Each point represents a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Sampling and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sample from the Model**:\n",
    "    * Start with an initial `context` of all `.` tokens.\n",
    "    * Enter a loop that continues until the model predicts a `.` token.\n",
    "    * Inside the loop, get the embeddings for the current `context` from the trained `C` matrix.\n",
    "    * Perform a forward pass through the hidden and output layers to get the `logits`.\n",
    "    * Apply `F.softmax` to the logits to get probabilities.\n",
    "    * Use `torch.multinomial` to sample the index of the next character.\n",
    "    * Append the new index to your output list and update the `context` by sliding the window.\n",
    "    * Finally, join the characters from the output list to form a new name.\n",

    "## Introduction and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture continues implementing \"makemore\" by transitioning from bigram language models to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). The previous bigram model used single character context to predict the next character through count-based probability tables, where each row summed to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Problem with Bigram Models:**\n",
    "- Limited to single character context produces poor, non-name-like predictions\n",
    "- Scaling to more context creates exponential growth in table size:\n",
    "  - 1 character context: 27 possibilities\n",
    "  - 2 character context: 27 × 27 = 729 possibilities  \n",
    "  - 3 character context: ~20,000 possibilities\n",
    "- Results in sparse counts and system breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Foundation: Bengio et al. 2003\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation follows the influential Bengio et al. 2003 paper on neural language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Paper's Approach:**\n",
    "- 17,000 word vocabulary embedded in 30-dimensional feature vectors\n",
    "- Words initially positioned randomly in embedding space\n",
    "- Through backpropagation, semantically similar words cluster together\n",
    "- Identical modeling approach: maximize log likelihood of training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight - Generalization Through Embeddings:**\n",
    "Example: \"A dog was running in a ___\"\n",
    "- Even if exact phrase never seen in training, model can generalize\n",
    "- If seen \"The dog was running in a ___\", embeddings for \"a\" and \"the\" learn similarity\n",
    "- Knowledge transfers through embedding space to novel scenarios\n",
    "- Similar concept applies to \"cats\" and \"dogs\" as animals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neural Network Architecture:**\n",
    "- Input: 3 previous words (indices 0-16999)\n",
    "- Embedding lookup table C: 17,000 × 30 matrix\n",
    "- Each word index retrieves corresponding 30-dimensional embedding\n",
    "- Input layer: 90 neurons (3 words × 30 dimensions)\n",
    "- Hidden layer: Hyperparameter size (e.g., 100 neurons), fully connected\n",
    "- Tanh nonlinearity\n",
    "- Output layer: 17,000 neurons (one per possible next word), fully connected\n",
    "- Softmax normalization for probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Process:**\n",
    "- Parameters include embedding table C, hidden layer weights/biases, output layer weights/biases\n",
    "- All optimized via backpropagation\n",
    "- Most computation in expensive output layer due to vocabulary size\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Preparation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "block_size = 3  # Context length (3 characters predict 4th)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Creation Process:**\n",
    "- Build examples from character sequences with padding dots\n",
    "- For word \"emma\": context [...] → e, [..e] → m, [.em] → m, [emm] → a, [mma] → .\n",
    "- Generate X (contexts) and Y (target characters) arrays\n",
    "- 32,000 names total, initially testing on first 5 words (32 examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Lookup Table:**\n",
    "- 27 possible characters embedded in lower-dimensional space\n",
    "- Start with 2D embeddings for visualization: 27 × 2 matrix C\n",
    "- Random initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing Methods:**\n",
    "1. Direct indexing: `C[5]` retrieves 5th row\n",
    "2. One-hot equivalent: `F.one_hot(torch.tensor(5), 27).float() @ C`\n",
    "   - Demonstrates embedding as first neural network layer\n",
    "   - Direct indexing preferred for efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Processing:**\n",
    "- PyTorch supports flexible indexing with lists, tensors, multi-dimensional arrays\n",
    "- `C[X]` embeds entire batch simultaneously\n",
    "- Output shape: 32 × 3 × 2 (batch_size × context_length × embedding_dim)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Network Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hidden Layer Construction:**\n",
    "- Input: Concatenated embeddings (3 × 2 = 6 dimensions)\n",
    "- Two concatenation approaches:\n",
    "  1. `torch.cat([emb[:, 0], emb[:, 1], emb[:, 2]], dim=1)` - creates new tensor\n",
    "  2. `emb.view(32, 6)` - efficient view manipulation (preferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "**View Operation Efficiency:**\n",
    "- PyTorch tensors have underlying 1D storage\n",
    "- `view()` manipulates tensor metadata (strides, shapes) without copying data\n",
    "- Extremely efficient compared to concatenation which creates new memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hidden Layer Forward Pass:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "h = torch.tanh(emb.view(-1, 6) @ W1 + b1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- W1: 6 × 100 weight matrix\n",
    "- b1: 100-dimensional bias vector\n",
    "- Broadcasting ensures bias added to each example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Layer:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logits = h @ W2 + b2\n",
    "```\n",
    "- W2: 100 × 27 weight matrix  \n",
    "- b2: 27-dimensional bias vector\n",
    "- Output: 32 × 27 logits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual Implementation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "counts = logits.exp()\n",
    "prob = counts / counts.sum(1, keepdim=True)\n",
    "loss = -prob[torch.arange(32), Y].log().mean()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyTorch Built-in (Preferred):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, Y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of F.cross_entropy:**\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Fused kernels, no intermediate tensors\n",
    "2. **Numerical stability**: Handles extreme logit values via offset subtraction\n",
    "3. **Simpler backward pass**: Analytically derived derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerical Stability Example:**\n",
    "- Large positive logits (e.g., 100) cause overflow in exp()\n",
    "- F.cross_entropy subtracts maximum logit value internally\n",
    "- Exploits property: softmax(x) = softmax(x + c) for any constant c\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Training Loop:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for _ in range(1000):\n",
    "    # Zero gradients\n",
    "    for p in parameters:\n",
    "        p.grad = None\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Forward pass\n",
    "    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, Y)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Backward pass\n",
    "    loss.backward()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Parameter update\n",
    "    for p in parameters:\n",
    "        p.data += -learning_rate * p.grad\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting Demonstration:**\n",
    "- 3,400 parameters vs 32 examples → easy overfitting\n",
    "- Achieves very low loss but not exactly zero\n",
    "- Limitation: same input contexts can have different valid outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mini-batch Training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Full dataset (228,000 examples) too slow per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Mini-batch gradient descent\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ix = torch.randint(0, X.shape[0], (32,))  # Random batch indices\n",
    "loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[ix], Y[ix])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Much faster iterations\n",
    "- Approximate gradients sufficient for progress\n",
    "- Better to take many approximate steps than few exact steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rate Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Rate Range Finding:**\n",
    "1. Test very low rates (e.g., 0.001) → minimal progress\n",
    "2. Test very high rates (e.g., 0.1, 1.0) → instability/explosion\n",
    "3. Use exponential spacing: `torch.linspace(-3, 0, 1000)` → `10**lre`\n",
    "4. Plot learning rate vs loss to find optimal range\n",
    "5. Choose rate from \"valley\" region of plot\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Process:**\n",
    "- Start with found learning rate\n",
    "- Train until plateau\n",
    "- Apply learning rate decay (10x reduction)\n",
    "- Continue training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train/Validation/Test Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Training loss alone insufficient for model evaluation\n",
    "- Models can memorize training data (overfitting)\n",
    "- Need generalization assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Split:**\n",
    "- **Training (80%)**: Parameter optimization via gradient descent  \n",
    "- **Validation/Dev (10%)**: Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- **Test (10%)**: Final performance evaluation (use sparingly)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n1 = int(0.8 * len(words))  # 80% train\n",
    "n2 = int(0.9 * len(words))  # 90% train+dev\n",
    "X_train, Y_train = build_dataset(words[:n1])\n",
    "X_dev, Y_dev = build_dataset(words[n1:n2])  \n",
    "X_test, Y_test = build_dataset(words[n2:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Scaling and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underfitting Diagnosis:**\n",
    "- Training loss ≈ Validation loss indicates underfitting\n",
    "- Solution: Increase model capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling Experiments:**\n",
    "1. **Hidden layer size**: 100 → 300 neurons\n",
    "2. **Embedding dimension**: 2 → 10 dimensions\n",
    "3. **Context length**: 3 → larger block_size\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Visualization (2D case):**\n",
    "- Plot character embeddings after training\n",
    "- Reveals learned structure: vowels cluster together\n",
    "- Special characters (q, .) positioned as outliers\n",
    "- Demonstrates meaningful learned representations\n",
